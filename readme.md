<!-- Title -->
# Control and supervision of a simulated boiler system

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This was my final project for the **real-time systems** discipline. In this project, a program was made to **supervise and control a simulated boiler** through a Java program provided by the book *Fundamentals of Real Time Systems* by **RÃ´mulo Silva de Oliveira**.

<!-- About the program -->
## About the program

The program was done in C, using specific techniques for real-time systems, such as mutual exclusion, monitors and double buffer. The system contains several sensors and actuators, you can see them in more detail and how they were made in the file ***controle-caldeira-2.pdf***, provided by the book.
